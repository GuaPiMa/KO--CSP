# A1046.Shortest Distance

### 题目描述：

The task is really simple: given *N* exits on a highway which forms a simple cycle, you are supposed to tell the shortest distance between any pair of exits.

### 输入格式：

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains an integer *N* (in [3,105]), followed by *N* integer distances *D*1 *D*2 ⋯ *D**N*, where *D**i* is the distance between the *i*-th and the (*i*+1)-st exits, and *D**N* is between the *N*-th and the 1st exits. All the numbers in a line are separated by a space. The second line gives a positive integer *M* (≤104), with *M* lines follow, each contains a pair of exit numbers, provided that the exits are numbered from 1 to *N*. It is guaranteed that the total round trip distance is no more than 107.

### 输出格式：

For each test case, print your results in *M* lines, each contains the shortest distance between the corresponding given pair of exits.
